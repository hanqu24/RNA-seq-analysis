## Arabidopsis time course

Here I provide the code which was used to contruct the RangedSummarizedExperiment object of the Arabidopsis time course data. The count matrix was provided by the first author of the publication:

Ursache R, De Jesus Vieira Teixeira C, Dénervaud Tendon V, Gully K et al. GDSL-domain proteins have key roles in suberin polymerization and degradation. Nat Plants 2021 Mar;7(3):353-364. PMID: 33686223

The data could be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE153478

Summary of data:'Here we show that differntiated endodermal cells have a distinct transcriptional response to auxin treatment. We perform a time serie of 10µM NAA treatment and sample at t=0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24hrs after NAA treatment. For the time series we compared roots of the solitairy root 1 (slr-1) mutant to the CASP1::shy2-2/slr-1 double mutant. We also provide RNAseq data of slr-1, CASP1::shy2-2 and CASP1::shy2-2/slr-1 at t=0'.
